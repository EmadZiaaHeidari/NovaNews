                                Houston-based Axiom has signed a memorandum of understanding with the
                                UK Space Agency to try to make it happen.

                                The project would probably cost Â£200m or more, but the idea is that it would be funded commercially.
                                There would be no contribution from UK taxpayers.
                                Axiom told the BBC that conversations with corporations and institutions
                                interested in providing finance were already under way.

                                The last UK individual to go into orbit was Tim Peake,
                                who flew to the ISS as a European Space Agency (Esa) astronaut in 2015.

                                "This is an exciting opportunity and actually unique," he commented.
                                "No-one has done a 'national mission', commercially, like this before. It's a new model and would be paving the
                                way for how we do space in the future."

                                Details are sparse at the moment. No crew has been chosen, nor is there a concept yet for
                                how it would be selected.
